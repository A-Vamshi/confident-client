# Background: Observability for AI Products

This is background/context, not Admin SDK API surface. It motivates _why_ teams
provision Confident AI projects and keys in the first place: to get
observability over AI products in production. Use it to explain the value of the
platform to stakeholders, not as a reference for administration calls.

## Core Idea

Evals alone are not enough. Think of evals as exams that tell you whether a
system passes or fails a test; observability is the day-to-day monitoring that
makes those exams meaningful. Without observability, evals are "like taking a
test in the dark."

Observability turns vague reports ("the AI seems off today") into specific,
fixable findings ("the AI fails on queries >50 words when context exceeds 10
documents, hallucinating between 2–4 PM PST during peak traffic"). The second
framing gets fixed because it comes with receipts: specific traces, timestamp
patterns, and a hypothesis.

## Traces Are "Clickstream Analytics for AI"

Modern observability tools are built for product teams, not just engineers. They
surface user journeys instead of stack traces:

- Instead of "Null pointer exception at line 187" → "AI retrieved 7 docs,
  generated response in 2.4s, ignored 3 docs."
- Instead of SQL joins and token counts → "Response took 3x longer than average"
  or "Hallucinated missing fields."

If you can read a funnel chart, you can read a trace.

## The ROI (Answering Common Objections)

- **"This is too technical."** Modern tools show user journeys, not raw logs.
- **"We don't have time."** Setup is ~30 minutes; debugging one real incident
  without observability can take 2–3 days. Over quarters that is weeks of lost
  velocity.
- **"Our AI isn't failing much."** AI fails gracefully — it looks right even
  when it's wrong (e.g. a bot books the wrong city 10% of the time; only the
  unlucky few complain). Without observability you're the frog in boiling water.

## Why This Belongs Next to the Admin SDK

Administration (this skill) is how you set up the account: create projects for
each agent/environment/customer, invite the team, and provision project API
keys. Those project keys are what an instrumented app uses to send traces and
run evals — the observability this article argues for. For the instrumentation
and eval work itself, see the `deepeval-tracing`, `deepeval-otel`, and
`deepeval` skills.
